      <h2 id="myheader">Downtown Freemont Street</h2>
      <p>
         When I got to the bright, beautifully lit city of Las Vegas, my first stop was to my
         hotel room at the historic Golden Gate Hotel on Freemont Street Downtown,
         which was the first hotel built in Vegas as well as the site of Nevada's first telephone. I checked into
         my room then walked back through the busy lobby full of slot machines and game tables to 
         the pack street of Freemont. People were everywhere enjoying the brightly illuminated signage and
         street performers were also scattered amongst the onlookers, adding to the celebritory atmosphere.
         Above the enclosed street of bright lights are the zip lines, sending passengers brave enough to fly high
         atop the sea of tourists and shoppers enjoying the concerts and other festivities. 
         I enjoyed every moment of Freemont, but I enjoyed the variety of drinks and food the most.

      <h2 id= myheader>The Stratosphere</h2>
      <p>
         After spending sometime on Freemont Street I then when south to the
         Stratosphere Hotel, which is at the very start of the Las Vegas Strip's 
         north end. The Stratosphere tower stands at a staggering 1,149 ft above 
         the warm desert and also includes a huge mall and hotel.  I went up to
         the top of the tower overlooking the illuminated Vegas skyline. Atop was a very nice 
         resturant, but the most popular attraction are the various thrill rides. One ride literally
         dangles passengers over the edge of the tower, leaving their feet dangling above the Strip.
         Another is a bungee-jump cable, in which a person can have a quick drink of liquid courage,
         and jump from the tower to ascend thousands of feet to a giant cushion waiting at the base.
         After seeing some brave soul jump from the edge with bungee cable attached, I quickly realised
         hieghts were not my thing and went back down the tower to enjoy the safety of shopping at the 
         many shops lined in hotel. As usual, I headed to the buffet and pigged-out.

      <h2 id=myheader>The Vegas Strip</h2>
      <p>
        With a full stomach, My next stop was to the world famous Las Vegas Strip. This is where the vast majority 
        of tourists and visitors congregate. The streets are filled with luxury cars, limousines and taxis taking
        people to and from their hotel. From the bright lights of the many casinos, to the thousands of shops, 
        attractions, clubs and resturants, there is so much to do that a person cannot possibly do everything in one
        trip, let only one night. I walked everywhere. One of the hotels that caught my eye was the Luxor Hotel, which
        is the huge egyptian themed pyramid featuring an illuminated beam at its peak, shooting into the night sky. 
        Another hotel that I enjoyed was the Mirage Hotel, equipped with a brilliant display of flames shooting from a
        scenic rocky cliff right along the strip. Each hotel is unique and has its own shopping area. Some have huge
        malls, complete with food courts and upscale resturants.

        <h3 id=myheader>My Stay at the Gold Gate Hotel</h3>
      </header>
      <p>My stay at the Golden Gate Hotel was, for the most part, a pretty nice one.
        If you are looking for the flash and glitz of some of the newer, mega hotels 
        Las Vegas has to offer, this is definitely not the hotel for you. However,
        if you want that turn-of-the-19th century feel, you'll love the antique achitecture
        and dimly lit hallways. The beds are comfortable, despite the rooms being small. That
        is a big contrast from the Golden Gate Casino. The lobby and game rooms are packed
        with gamblers and tourists. The bar tenders and dealers are dressed in attire 
        reminiscent of the 1920s. The best part is that the Hotel lies right in the heart
        of all the action of The Freemont Street Experience.
